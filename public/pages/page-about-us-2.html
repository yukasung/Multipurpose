                    <p>Consultants provide their advice to their clients in a variety of forms. Reports and presentations are
                        often used. However, in some specialized fields, the consultant may develop customized software or
                        other products for the client. Depending on the nature of the consulting services and the wishes
                        of the client, the advice from the consultant may be made public placing the report or presentation
                        online, or the advice may be kept confidential, and only given to the senior executives.</p>
                    <p>While many consultants work for firms there is also an increasing number of independent consultants.</p>

                    <p>Though most of the back-office research and analysis occurs at the consultants' offices or home-offices,
                        in the case of smaller consulting firms consultants typically work at the site of the client for
                        at least some of the time. By spending time at the client's organization, the consultant is able
                        to observe work processes, interview workers, managers, executives, board members, or other individuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>Financial management overlaps with the financial function of the accounting profession. However, financial
                        accounting is the reporting of historical financial information, while financial management is concerned
                        with the allocation of capital resources to increase a firm's value to the shareholders and increase
                        their rate of return on the investments.</p>
                    <p>Corporate finance also includes within its scope business valuation, stock investing, or investment management.
                        An investment is an acquisition of an asset in the hope that it will maintain.</p>
