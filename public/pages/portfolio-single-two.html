                        <p>In computer science and information science, system is a software system which has components as
                            its structure and observable inter-process communications as its behavior. Again, an example
                            will illustrate: There are systems of counting, as with Roman numerals, and various systems for
                            filing papers, or catalogues, and various library systems, of which the Dewey Decimal Classification
                            is an example. This still fits with the definition of components which are connected together
                            (in this case to facilitate the flow of information).</p>
