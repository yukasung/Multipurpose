                    <p>In computer science and information science, system is a software system which has
                        components as
                        its structure and observable inter-process communications as its behavior. Again, an
                        example
                        will illustrate: There are systems of counting, as with Roman numerals, and various systems
                        for
                        filing papers, or catalogues, and various library systems, of which the Dewey Decimal
                        Classification
                        is an example. This still fits with the definition of components which are connected
                        together
                        (in this case to facilitate the flow of information).</p>

                    <p>Social and cognitive sciences recognize systems in human person models and in human
                        societies. They
                        include human brain functions and mental processes as well as normative ethics systems and
                        social/cultural
                        behavioral patterns.</p>
